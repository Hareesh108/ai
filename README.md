## 🔥 Current Trends in LLMs

The field of LLMs is rapidly evolving. Some of the **latest research and engineering trends** include:

1. **Reasoning (RLVR, GRPO)**  
   - *RLVR (Reinforcement Learning via Verifiable Rewards):* ensures models get rewarded for provably correct reasoning steps.  
   - *GRPO (Generalized Reinforcement Policy Optimization):* an advanced RL method for improving structured reasoning.  

2. **MoEs (Mixture of Experts)**  
   - Models with multiple expert subnetworks, where only a subset activates per query.  
   - Enables efficiency and scalability.  
   - Example: *Mixtral of Experts*.  

3. **Tool Use**  
   - LLMs can call external tools (APIs, calculators, databases, code execution).  
   - Moves LLMs from static text generators to **active AI agents**.  

4. **Multi-Head Latent Attention**  
   - Extends multi-head attention to focus on latent (hidden) representations.  
   - Enhances reasoning depth and compression of long contexts.
